        <p>
            Paired with side dishes and rice, this chicken makes for a wonderful meal, and it especially goes well with kimchi. It still tastes great even when cooled down, so itâ€™s perfect to use in lunchboxes that are prepared in the morning and eaten later. I use boneless chicken thighs but you can use legs or breasts as long as they are without bones, so that they can cook quickly on the pan.

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the chicken with the milk in a large bowl. Refridgerate for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine soy sauce, pepper, garlic, ginger, and rice syrup in a bowl and mix well.</li>
            <li>Put the chicken back in the bowl and pat dry with paper towel to remove excess moisture.</li>
            <li>Add the sauce mixture to the chicken and mix well.</li>
            <li>Prepare a cast-iron skillet or grill pan over medium high heat.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the vegetable oil over the grill. Put the chicken on the grill, spreading it out so it cooks in an even layer.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium and cover. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Open and turn the chicken over. Increase the heat to medium high, and scrape the marinade in the bowl onto the chicken, flipping the meat from time to time so that it doesn't overcook or burn.</li>
            <li>Using tongs, rub the butter all over the chicken. Turn them over and cook for another minute.</li>
            <li>After 1 minute, transfer the chicken to a plate and sprinkle chopped green onion. Serve with rice and kimchi.</li>
        </ol>
